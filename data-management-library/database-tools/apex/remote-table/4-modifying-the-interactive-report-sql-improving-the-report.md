# Module 4: Modifying the Interactive Report SQL - Improving the Report

### Information

For any given country, if you divide the Local Price of a Big Mac by the Local Price of a Big Mac in the US, for the same time period, you can calculate the relative exchange rates between the countries based on the Big Mac prices.

If you then subtract the Dollar Exchange Rate from the relative exchange rate, and divide by the Dollar Exchange Rate, then you can determine if the currency is overvalued (positive) or undervalued (negative), against the US Dollar.

While this is not an exact determination of if a currency is overvalued or undervalued against the US Dollar, it is a good approximation using a product which is generally available in most
countries.

             local_price / (select local_price from big_mac_index u
                           where u.entry_date = l.entry_date
                           and   u.iso = 'USA'
                          )

      from BIG_MAC_INDEX l
