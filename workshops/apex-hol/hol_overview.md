# Oracle Application Express: Developing Database Web Applications

## Hands-On-Labs Guide: Hands-On Overview

This series of hands-on labs is designed to teach you how to build applications using Application Express. The primary vehicle for teaching is a single use case which is expanded on with each lab. 

The primary use case is that your team tracks projects you are currently working on. Rather than using a spreadsheet or some commercial project tracking tool you have been tasked with building a Web application so that the team has a custom application that meets everyone's requirements. The DBA has created a script which creates various tables and populates them with the current data.
 
In this series of hands-on-labs, you also quickly build two simple applications. You use a spreadsheet to create the Budget App application that allows everyone to maintain the  project cost and budget data. The Hardware application is used to make purchasing decisions of the hardware in different departments. You will then greatly improve these two applications and utilize a number of techniques such as Interactive Grids, and Interactive Reports.
