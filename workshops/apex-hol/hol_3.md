**Oracle Application Express: Developing Database Web Applications**

**Hands-On-Labs Guide**

*Unit 3: Creating a Database Application*

This exercise includes two hands-on-labs.

**HOL 3-1 Creating a Database Application from Scratch**: In this hands-on-lab, you create a database Web application, Demo Projects. You will extend and improve this application later.

**HOL 3-2 Creating a Database Application from a Spreadsheet**: In this hands-on lab, you use a spreadsheet to create a database Web application, Budget App. You do not extend this application but will use in a later exercise.

### HOL 3-1: Creating a Database Application from Scratch

In this lab, you create the initial application using the Create Application wizard to define multiple pages. Now that you have created the underlying tables, you are ready to create a desktop application. You will be adding reports and forms for the tables you created.
Generally, when developing an application you will not know all of the pages required at the beginning. Therefore, you will only generate a select number of pages initially, and then use the wizard to add additional pages as required. However, for this exercise you will generate most of the pages required for the application up front.

1. Using the Create Application Wizard, create the Demo Projects application. Navigate to **App Builder** and then click **Create**.
